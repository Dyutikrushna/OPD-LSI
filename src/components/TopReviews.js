          Personal interaction with Dr was satisfactory and a pleasant
          experience as we had to rush to the doctor as an emergency situation.
          My daughter and we (parent) had a sleepless night just before the day
          due to high body temperature and loose motions of my daughter.The
          experience was bit bitter due to the wait time at the clinic and
          mismanagement by the staffs. Earlier when I called at the clinic
          arround morning 7.30am they told no appointment booking over phone but
          at the clinic the situation seem different and we had to wait more
          than an hour to meet the doctor. We reached the clinic at arround 9am
          but we only got a chance to meet the doctor by 10.40am, in between
          which my daughter had to use the washroom twice.

          When it comes to treatment of my 3.5 years daughter I am blindly going
          to recommend Dr. Tapas. Be in case of any ailment or vaccination. He
          is probably the best in his field. Very patient and friendly Doctor.
          Listens to issues very patiently and everytime we visited him we never
          have to return back for same issue again. Only thing to keep in mind
          is to book in advance over call to avoid long queue.

          We visited Dr. Tapas for baby's vaccination. He was very friendly and
          explained well on our queries. For sure he is my baby's pediatrician
          when we are in Bhubaneswar. Thank you.
